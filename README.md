# Kali i3-gaps | Custom ISO
## Introduction
This is my take on Kali, using i3-gaps as a WM. I've done this because I've
loved how i3-gaps worked on my new (well, it was new back in May 2019) laptop.
It is really lightweight (compared to other WM's and DE's) while being really
customizable and easy to use; especially as a guy with large hands and long
fingers.

## Building
To build this ISO first install the dependencies, then clone the Git repo from either
Github or Gitlab. Afterwards, `cd` into `kali-i3-gaps` and start the build script.

```
$ sudo apt install -y curl git live-build cdebootstrap
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/Arszilla/kali-i3-gaps.git
$ cd kali-i3-gaps
$ ./build.sh --variant i3wm --verbose
```

or

```
$ sudo apt install -y curl git live-build cdebootstrap
$ git clone https://github.com/Arszilla/kali-i3-gaps.git
$ cd kali-i3-gaps
$ ./build.sh --variant i3wm --verbose
```

If you are on a non-Kali Debian based system, check out Kali's
[guide](https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/)
on building the ISO. Once the script is finished, your image should be in
`~/kali-i3-gaps/images`.

## Using the image

You can create a VM directly in VirtualBox with the ISO. Common issues with
VirtualBox can be found [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch12.html) and
community provided ressources [here] (https://forums.virtualbox.org/) .


## Bug Reports
I've been working on this since late November. There might be some errors here
and there; bugs and/or features from official Kali I've missed. If that's the
case and you find a bug and/or a missing feature:

- Fork the repo
- Make changes
- Submit a PR

I'll evaluate them ASAP and get back to you.

## Keybinds
Now, this is the most important part about this ISO and i3-gaps in general.
Unless you are familiar with i3-gaps, you might be confused on how to do
anything on it. For the sake of newcomers, most vital keybinds are as follows:

- Mod key: Windows (Between Ctrl & Alt, usually)
- Launch a urxvt: `Mod + Return`
- Launch Rofi: `Mod + d`
- Launch Firefox: `Mod  +F1`
- Launch a file pcmanfm file manager: `Mod + F2`
- Launch a file ranger file manager: `Mod + F3`
- Switch workspaces: `Mod + 0-9`
- Move the current window to another workspace: `Mod + Shift + 0-9`
- Launch the system menu: `Mod + 0`
- Switch between tiling and floating windows: `Mod + Shift + Space`
- Move the window: `Mod + Shift` and arrow keys or `jkl;`
- Resize the window: `Mod + R` then arrow keys or `jkl;`
- Take a fullscreen screenshot: `Mod + Print`
- Take a screenshot of a window: `Mod + Shift + Print`
- Take a screenshot of an area: `Mod + Ctrl + Print`

Rest of the keybinds could be found in `~/.config/i3/config`

## Customization
i3 is *really* customizable, which is one of the perfect aspects of it IMO. A
summary on customization is as follows:

- `~/.config` holds the majority of the dotfiles/Customization
- `~/.config/i3/config` is i3-gaps' dotfile. You can change keybinds, execs,
look and feel as well as many more aspects of your i3-gaps here. You can make
your containers open in certain workspaces. For more information, check out
[i3wm docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html).
- `~/.config/i3status` is the i3status dotfile. You can customize your bar to
your liking. For more information, check out
[i3status docs](https://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html).
- `~/.Xresources` is your Xresources file, where you can customize your X
client applications. This includes `urxvt` and `rofi`.
- `~/.config/compton/compton.conf` is the compton config. You can edit your
compositor's settings here.
- `~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` is the dunst dotfile. You can customize your
notification delivery system here.
